17:11:48	 From yash : Create a simple python application that uses Langchain & Groq to make a simple LLM call and returns the response. There should be a Question asked to the user on the CLI. And the response should be returned on the CLI. This should continue happening in a loop. Keep the GROQ api key and model name configurable in a props file. Add enough inline comments. Create requirements.txt as well.
